This is a collection of astronomical observing plans.

# Use

The main purpose of an observing plan is to control an observatory, e.g. a computer-controlled telescope in a designated dark sky site.

A simple plan may instruct the guided mount to point the telescope to a particular celestial object. A more useful plan may instruct the observatory to capture a series of images of said celestial object using a CCD. 


## Format

[iTelescope.net](http://www.itelescope.net), my remote observatory of choice, uses a highly modified version of ACP. As such, some of these plans may contain keywords specific to the ACP software used by iTelescope.net.

## Structure

The telescopes provided by iTelescope.net may be attached to a variety of CCDs. These can be divided into two groups: color CCDs, and grayscale CCDs. A color CCD is similar to what you would find in a DSLR and their output is for all intents and purposes a RGB color image. Grayscale CCDs will, as expected, produce grayscale images. These grayscale CCDs usually have a filter wheel attached to them, which allows you to capture Red, Green, and Blue colors, as well as an assortment of narrowband images with their OIII and Ha filters. By filtering out everything but a specific band of the visual spectrum, your instrument is able to capture more detail with shorter exposure times than those afforded by a color CCD.

With that in mind, observing plans are divided into `color` and `filtered` directories.
